## Description

This work day scheduler allows users to save events based on the hours of a working day. It uses Moment.js to generate the current time and tasks made are saved onto local storage so that those tasks remain when the page is refreshed.

Past tasks are highlighted in grey, curent tasks are highlighted in red and future tasks are highlighted in green.

## User Story
